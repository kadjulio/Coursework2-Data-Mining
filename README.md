# Coursework1 - Data mining & Maching learning

## Requirements

* Docker
* Datasets (add to /data/raw/ in the checkout)

Docker needs to be allowed to use at least 11GB of memory - his is an option in the docker settings.

That's it! Docker compose takes care of the rest.

## Initiate docker

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Launch docker

``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Access the jupyter lab

Go to http://localhost:8888
